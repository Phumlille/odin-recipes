        <p>A Symphony of Flavors in Every Bite</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cucumbers:</strong> This bibimap recipe starts with cucumbers, cut into matchsticks, mixed with gochujang (optional, but it adds subtle heat).</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> You'll also need spinach, cut into thin strips, and carrots, cut into matchsticks.</li>
            <li><strong>Soy sauce:</strong>Soy sauce lends umami-rich flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive oil</strong>: Cook the carrots and garlic in olive oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Take the flavor up a notch with fresh garlic and dried red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Steak:</strong> This recipe calls for thinly-sliced beef â€” top round steak is rich and beefy, which makes it perfect for bibimbap.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> You'll need one whole egg per serving.</li>
            <li><strong>Rice:</strong> Ladle each serving over bibimbap over a cup of cooked white rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Sesame oil:</strong> Toasting the sesame oil brings out a depth of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Sesame seeds:</strong> A teaspoon of sesame seeds are the perfect finishing touch.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Stir the cucumber pieces and gochujang together in a bowl.</li>

            <li>Brown the beef in a different skillet and set aside. </li>
