        <h2>Power Your Day with Our Quinoa Bowls!</h2>
        <p>Simple dish that is very healthy, vegetarian, and can be a side or main course. Great to make and pack as a lunch for a few days after.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>3 sweet potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, or more to taste</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup asparagus, or more to taste</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>2 cups quinoa</li>
            <li>1 cup cashews</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add sweet potatoes and salt; stir to coat sweet potatoes with oil and saute until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Transfer sweet potatoes to a plate and season with more salt.</li>
            <li>Saute onion and garlic in the same skillet until softened, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add asparagus, cover, and steam until tender, about 4 minutes. Cut asparagus into 1/2-inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Toss sweet potatoes, onion-garlic mixture, asparagus, and quinoa together in a bowl; cool to room temperature. Add cashews and top with more olive oil and salt.</li>
        </ol>
